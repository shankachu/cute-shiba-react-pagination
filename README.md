# Using Pagination in React
This is a very simple React JS app to show you how to use Pagination to make API calls get lots of cute dog pictures (I love dogs). Every time the user chooses a page, we will fetch data from the API and lazy loaded for the user to view.

Demo: https://shankachu-cute-dogs-pagination.pages.dev/


# Get started

npm run install

npm start

## MUI
For the beauty for our eye and easiness, we have implemented MUI to have easy access to the **Pagination** Component.

## TheDogApi

You need to get a free API token from https://thedogapi.com/ to pass in the header to make the calls.
